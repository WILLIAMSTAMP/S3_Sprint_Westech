const mongoose = require('mongoose')

// Mongoose is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB. While you donâ€™t need to use an Object Data Modeling (ODM) or Object Relational Mapping (ORM) tool to have a great experience with MongoDB, some developers prefer them. Many Node.js developers choose to work with Mongoose to help with data modeling, schema enforcement, model validation, and general data manipulation. And Mongoose makes these tasks effortless.
const connectDB = async () => {
    try {
        await mongoose.connect(process.env.DATABASE_URI)
    } catch (err) {
        console.log(err)
    }
}

module.exports = connectDB
